## About This Site

Therapist Specialty is a therapist/client compatibility app based off of likert scale quizzes.

### Built With

  - React.js
  - Zurb Foundation
  - Auth 0
  - MongoDB

## Starting the app locally

Start by installing front and backend dependencies. While in this directory, run the following command:

```
npm install
```

This should install node modules within the server and the client folder.

After both installations complete, run the following command in your terminal:

```
npm start
```

Your app should now be running on <http://localhost:3000>. The Express server should intercept any AJAX requests from the client.
